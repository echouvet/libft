# libft (Lib Fourty Two)

Libft is a project prescribed at the very beginning of our 42 curriculum. The subject is visible in the Sujet.pdf file at the root of this repository.

This project consists some basic Lib C functions, to better understand them when using them in future projects.

I've used this library of functions for the projects: FDF, Fract'ol, Wolf3D. All visible within this github account.
